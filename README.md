The current project is to create a webpage, one of the recipe webpage variety. The skills I will have demonstrated by the end seem primarily focused around HTML and utilizing Github. Now that I have finished the assignment I feel far more confident in the way paragraphs and the general layouts work in HTML I also found it redundant scrolling everywhere so I added a simple home button to help with navigation.
